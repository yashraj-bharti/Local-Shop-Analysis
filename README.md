# Local-Shop-Analysis
ðŸ“Š Sales Data Analysis Using SQL Server
ðŸš€ Project Overview

This project demonstrates end-to-end data analysis using SQL Server on the Local Shop retail dataset.
The objective is to explore, analyze, and generate actionable business insights through SQL queries, KPIs, and advanced techniques like window functions and outlier detection.

ðŸ”‘ Key Features & Analysis

âœ… Data Cleaning & Transformation
Standardized inconsistent values (e.g., Low Fat, LF â†’ Low Fat) for accurate reporting.

âœ… Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Total & Average Sales across multiple dimensions

Sales distribution by Item Type, Fat Content, and Outlet Size

KPIs including Total Sales, Avg Sales, No. of Items, Avg Ratings

âœ… Business Insights

Top 10 Best-Selling Item Types

Least-Selling Item Types (candidates for discontinuation)

Sales by Outlet Establishment Year (impact of outlet age on performance)

Sales % Contribution by Outlet Size & Location

Correlation Checks: Item Visibility vs. Sales, Item Weight vs. Sales

âœ… Advanced SQL Concepts Used

Window Functions â†’ Ranking outlets & products by sales

Pivot Queries â†’ Comparing Fat Content sales across locations

CTEs (Common Table Expressions) â†’ Clean modular queries

Outlier Detection â†’ Flagging unusually high/low performing outlets

ðŸ“ˆ Sample Insights

Outlets established earlier consistently show higher sales stability.

High shelf visibility correlates with better sales.

Certain item categories dominate total revenue (Pareto effect).

Outliers detected â†’ A few outlets significantly underperform compared to peers.
